# Pull Request Process

Once you have implemented a change and have created a PR to the repo, the review of the PR will follow this process.

1. The code author should assign a reviewer using the "Assignees" field (do not use the "Reviewers" field) of the PR. The assignee is the person who is currently responsible for taking action on the PR.

2. Do not push any more commits to the PR while it is assigned to a reviewer without talking to the reviewer first. This can mess up any comments that the reviewer may be in the process of making.

3. The reviewer will review the changes and provide appropriate feedback. If there are changes the reviewer would like the author to make, the reviewer will request those changes using the "Request changes" option on the review in the PR and then assign the PR back to the author.

4. If you are responding to comments made by a reviewer you can respond in one of two ways. If you simply make a requested change and don't have any comments to add or explanations to make, just click "Resolve conversation" to resolve the conversation. If for some reason, you decide not to make a change requested by a reviewer, you should add a comment explaining why not and leave the conversation unresolved. If you do make a requested change but also want to add a comment with some explanation, then add the explanation and also leave the conversation unresolved. Only resolve a conversation if you have nothing to add.
 
5. Do not use rebase to squash your commits or amend commits under review while the review is unresolved. If a review ends up with multiple rounds of reviews, squashing the commits makes it impossible for a reviewer to review just the changes made since the last review.

6. Once you have completed the requested changes, assign the PR back the reviewer.

Note: All conversations should be resolved before a PR is merged.
